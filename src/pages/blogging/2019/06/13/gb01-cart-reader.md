Got my hands on one of Submodule’s [GB01 Cart Readers](https://submodule.co/) (as seen on [Retro Game Couch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsrlM1nDnyE) and [The Retro Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhAYsF4g3zY)). Dumped all my game cartridges and save games to my Mac and I gotta say—it feels good to play “my” game roms in emulators.
