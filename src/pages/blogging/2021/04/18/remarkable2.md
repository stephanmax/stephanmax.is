Quick praise of my trusty [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/) as it has become my daily companion for bullet journaling, university, and reading. Using [ddvk’s remarkable-hacks](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks) for some much-needed additonal functionality and [KOReader](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-autoinstall/tree/master/rm2), a fantastic e-reader app that definitely trumps Remarkable’s built-in reader software in every aspect.

The best thing, though, is hooking up my local [COPS server](https://github.com/seblucas/cops) with KOReader as an OPDS source and using it as my own little Kindle eShop—without USB connection or Remarkable cloud.
