If you live in Germany and are concerned about the Freedom of Information Act in this country, please consider donating to [Frag den Staat](https://fragdenstaat.de/), a nonprofit organization of the [Open Knowledge Foundation Germany](https://okfn.de/en/) that “brings light into the darkness of the authorities.” I am not affiliated with them, but I follow and admire their work since I became a mentor with [Jugend Hackt](https://jugendhackt.org/), another OKF Germany venture.

They just released their [latest art print](https://fragdenstaat.de/spenden/kunstedition/) as an additional goody for a 250€ donation—and it is a beauty!
