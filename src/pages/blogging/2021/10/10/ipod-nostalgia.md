Tomorrow we are moving to apartment No. 2 here in Hamburg. High time I praised a wonderful device that has woken us up for the past four weeks: The Philips DC220/12 radio alarm clock (top left). What a coincidence that this apartment came with the perfect companion for my trusted modded 5th gen iPod (bottom)!

For me (and a gazillion other people, I’m sure), the whole iPod nostalgia was sparked by the movie *Baby Driver* (top right) and writer/director Edgar Wright’s own gusto for [music and retro tech](https://twitter.com/edgarwright/status/881314530168459264).

I own two modded iPods and one is usually part of my <abbr title="Everyday Carry">EDC</abbr>:

* Black 6th gen iPod Classic 160Gb (not depicted), with an [iFlash Solo](https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-solo/) and an 128Gb SD card (unfortunately, the upper limit for a 6th gen iPod), do not forget to also buy the required [HDD ribbon](https://www.iflash.xyz/store/hdd-ribbon/) for the 160Gb model
* White 5th gen iPod Classic 30Gb (depicted above), with an [iFlash Quad](https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-quad/) and two 200Gb SD cards

I can highly recommend breathing life into your old iPods by modding them. The 5th gen iPods’ music chip is concidered top of its class. Check out [iFlash’s compatibility page](https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-compatibility/) and see for yourself what’s possible.
