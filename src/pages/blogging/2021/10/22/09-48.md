üéâ I [finished](https://coursera.org/share/49c462b7194dd90882fc13fc6a357d52) the Coursera <abbr title="Massive Open Online Course">MOOC</abbr> [From NAND to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) today and I had a blast with it! I learned how to build a full-fledged von-Neumann-inspired computer in software from the simplest logic gates (like the eponymous *NAND* or ‚Äúnot and‚Äù gate). If you are into puzzle-solving and interested in how even the most powerful computers work at their very core, I can highly recommend this course.

It is so rewarding! It comes with a whole suite of simulators and test suites to guide you through the six weeks of hands-on projects and is absolutely doable without any programming skills.

The course inspired me to tackle two projects (hopefully soon):

* Take the follow-up course [Nand to Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) that focuses on implementing a high-level programming language on top of the computer built in part 1
* Create an interactive Hack Assembler in JavaScript
