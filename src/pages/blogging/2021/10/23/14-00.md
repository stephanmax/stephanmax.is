We used our slow Saturday to visit the [Emigration Museum BallinStadt](https://www.ballinstadt.de/?lang=en) here in Hamburg. Apparently a museum that has long been on the to-do list of my wife. What an impressive visit!

The museum is located in Hamburg’s historic emigration halls, a central hub for tens of thousands of people on their path out of Europe and towards a hoped-for brighter future. The different expositons of the museum go further, though, and actually tell the story of world-wide emigration spanning four eras: 16th–19th century, 19th century, the big wars of the 20th century, and post-1945.

Be prepared for many original items alongside educational—and emotional—text panels and interactive media. If you do not speak German download the [app](https://www.ballinstadt.de/ballinstadtxplore/?lang=en) for English audio and bring headphones.
