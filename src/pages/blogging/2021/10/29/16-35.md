I finished the [Introduction to Data Science in Python MOOC](https://coursera.org/share/4c32e221e438aff4351c99f539a3bb2a) on Coursera (Highly recommended!) and am in the middle of the [PyData Global 2021](https://pydata.org/global2021/) virtual conference packed with interesting talks and workshops.
