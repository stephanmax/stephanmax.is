We visited the [Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe](https://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/home.html) in Hamburg today and attended a tour of the current exhibition [Heimaten](https://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/exhibitions/current/heimaten.html). For me, though, the two hidden gems of the museum are the exhibition of German illustrator and author [Janosch](https://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/exhibitions/current/janosch.html)—a celebration of quirkiness and the powers of imagination—and the book store.
