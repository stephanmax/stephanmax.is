Back in March 2017 I backed a film on [StartNext](https://www.startnext.com/leifinconcert) (aka *German Kickstarter*) called *Leif in Concert, Vol. 2* and you can watch it on [ARTE’s media library](https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/103950-000-A/leif-in-concert/) now! ([Trailer here](https://vimeo.com/421605800) and download via [MediathekWebView](https://arteptweb-a.akamaihd.net/am/ptweb/103000/103900/103950-000-A_SQ_0_VOA_05942484_MP4-2200_AMM-PTWEB_1a4WEgZEwb.mp4).)

This is the first time I have been part of movie credits and the movie has turned out beautifully. Especially now that we are facing a possible fourth Covid wave and visits to your favorite bar and club are becoming wishful thinking I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It’s bringing you right back at those enchanting moments:  beautiful strangers, a beer with your best buddies, those random disputes with the bartender.

Also, [the soundtrack](https://www.leifinconcert.de/shop-1) is mesmerizing! Check out “Wild Bill Jones” by *Poorboy* and “Young Again” by *Kaspar Bjørke*—my personal favorites.
