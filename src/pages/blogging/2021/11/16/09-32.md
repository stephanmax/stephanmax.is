Unfortunately, [Philip Summers](https://twitter.com/heyphilsummers) had to cancel his Kickstarter [Hand-Drawn Game Guides](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/handdrawngameguides/hand-drawn-game-guides).

On the bright side, this fine gentleman made the two original game guides accessible completely for free:

* [*The Legend of Zelda* on Zelda Universe](https://zeldauniverse.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda/)
* [*Metroid* on Metroid Database](https://www.metroid-database.com/guides/)
