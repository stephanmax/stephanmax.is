I played through the wonderful *Metroid Dread*:

* Took me 09:24:55 on a 2nd gen Switch
* Uncovered 39% of items
* The difficulty level was challenging but never frustrating (easier than *Hollow Knight*, harder than *Monster Boy*), I only died in boss battles, the final boss took me 8 tries
* The audiovisual presentation is top-notch, the game runs without stutter at a buttery 60 FPS and the controls are precise, soundtrack and sound effects are beautiful and really help the immersion

Final verdict: ★★★★★

It’s been an honor, Samus! Definitely *Game of the Year* material for me!
