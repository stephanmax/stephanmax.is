Today I stumbled upon [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org/), a markup language for recipes. I am beyond excited about this and already gave the CLI tool that comes with the project a spin. As a computer scientist who is starting to look into meal prepping, the idea of storing, sharing, forking recipes as future-proof text files with some nice apps on top is very appealing to me.
