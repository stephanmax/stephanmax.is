Bye, Hamburg! Those two months in the—yes, I am tying myself down to it—best city in Germany have passed quickly. Our stay has been wonderful and filled with amazing moments with friends and everything Hamburg has to offer. It was inspirational and I learned a lot about where, but more importantly *how* I want to live.

## What I Will Miss

* Our friends in Hamburg
* The Nordic people in general, their fine sense of humor, their understatement
* The bustle of the city right in front of our front door
* Walks through the vibrant quarters of Schanze, St. Pauli, Eimsbüttel, Altona, Ottensen
* Jogging through Schanzenpark, working at [Beehive Bahrenfeld](https://www.beehive.work/de/ort/hamburg-bahrenfeld)
* The ever-present vibe of the sea and vastness
* The city’s juggling act between fancy pants crowd and black bloc, rich and washed-up, cosmopolitan city and neighborhood romanticism
* The crappy weather and how people spend their time outside regardless

## What I Won’t Miss

* Paying for public transportation
