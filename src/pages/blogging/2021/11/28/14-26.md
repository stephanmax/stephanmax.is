Today I finished *Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King*, a cute little 2D Zelda clone.

* Everything you would expect from a 2D Zelda clone: heart containers, weapons and items, smooth pixel graphics, dungeons and bosses
* Definitely on the easy side, especially the late game when you have a lot of potions and heart containers
* Lovely touch: The whole game is a story that a grandfather is telling his two grandchildren

Final verdict: ★★★☆☆

Happy to have played through this one but won’t revisit. Too easy and without the gravitas of the Zelda lore.
