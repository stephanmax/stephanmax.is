I feel honored to announce that the <i>Open Knowledge Foundation</i> (OKFN) has granted me a <i>Frictionless Data Tool fund</i> to improve the landscape of <i>reproducible research</i>.

I will use this one-time $5,000 grant to develop a Google Sheets extension that imports/exports [Data Packages](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/).
